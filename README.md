Python Unified Runtime Environment (PURE) is a Simple, Distraction-Free Code Editor and Interpreter that Let's You Code in Peace ✌️

# Future Ideas:

- Extend this to multiple programming languages, mainly formatting languages like HTML, Markdown, LaTeX where it is important to have the output refresh every few seconds
- Create a config file where the user can enter various environments they wish and it gets automatically added, ofcourse, only if they have that setup already installed
- Deploy the project in docker to avoid dependency hell and for easy running and deployment of everything
- Make everything more user friendly and intuitive
- Why this project add in readme? (instantly see outputs on the side as you work, work on small code snippets that you want to instantly execute, don't worry about setting up paths and environment, just run this and it will take cover of the rest)
